# Analog Wack-A-Mole

## Project Description

Analog Wack-A-Mole is a game project implemented using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, SCSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The game is designed to mimic the classic arcade Wack-A-Mole game with a modern web development stack.

## Features

- **Gameplay:** Try to finish 50 levels without losing health. Some moles attack, some heal. Hit fast and accurately; losing means starting over.
- **User Interface:** Styled using Tailwind CSS and SCSS for a clean and responsive design.
- **TypeScript:** Utilized for robust and type-safe code.
- **HTML & JavaScript:** Core structure and dynamic interactions.
